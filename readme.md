## welcome to emerald!

[emerald](https://jpegzilla.com/emerald) is pretty simple. I just made it mainly to combine three of my favorite color tools &mdash; [monochrome](https://monochrome.jxnblk.com/), [contrast-ratio](https://contrast-ratio.com/), and [coolors](https://coolors.co/app).

you can install this, by the way. [it's a pwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications)

things I'll be adding in the coming months / weeks:

- [ ] palette exporting (as images, css, scss)
- [ ] sharing color combinations through url params (easy enough)
- [ ] full palette generation and randomization (a feature that coolors has)
- [ ] preview extra shades of current colors
- [ ] refactoring my *filthy, nasty* scss
- [ ] settings (exclude certain color ranges, change randomization parameters...?)
- [ ] show approximate css color name even if the css color isn't *exactly* the same
